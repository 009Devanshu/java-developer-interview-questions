	var x = 3; //without decimal
	var y = 3.6; //with decimal

Difference between var, let and const. 
-----------------------------------------------------
Ans:
var: If we declare a variable from var, then we also declare it again with the same name, and if we want to reassign its value then we can do that too. 
let: If we declare a variable with let, then we can not declare it again with the same name, but we can re-assign its value. 
const: If we decalre a variable with const, then we can neither declare it again, nor can re-assign its value. 


Scope:- var has a function scope or global scope if declared outside any function, let has a block scope. A block is denoted by curly braces {}. This means that variables declared with let are limited in scope to the block in which they are defined.

// Example using var
function exampleVar() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;
    }
    console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
}

// Example using let
function exampleLet() {
    if (true) {
        let y = 20;
    }
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
